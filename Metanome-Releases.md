To release a new version of Metanome the `maven-release-plugin` is used.

A summary of how to pushing to Maven Central with Sonatype can be found [here](http://bealetech.com/blog/2013/04/10/pushing-to-maven-central-with-sonatype/).

During the release process, the release has to be signed. 
Therefore, the [`maven-gpg-plugin`](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-gpg-plugin/usage.html) is used. 
The `maven-gpg-plugin` belongs to a profile called `performRelease`. 
So you only need the gpg authentication files, if you want to release Metanome. 
To turn on the profile add `-DperformRelease=true` to your maven command when releasing Metanome.

For pushing Metanome to Sonatype you need the correct access rights. 
Therefore you have to create a JIRA account and open a ticket to get developer access to Metanome. 
For details see here.

To check whether you have the correct access rights or not, see this [page](http://blog.sonatype.com/2010/11/what-to-do-when-nexus-returns-401/#.Vp9K-XUrJvA).

If `mvn release:prepare` is successfully executed, git has created a tag with the version id. 
If an error occurs during the next steps and you want to roll back everything, you have to delete this tag. How to delete it, is explained [here](https://nathanhoad.net/how-to-delete-a-remote-git-tag).
