# Functional Dependencies
Instead of tooltips: Highlight all columns, which functionally determine columns, in a different color than those columns, which depend on this column gorup.

Adapt the width of the circular arc segment to the number of dependencies. The wider the circular arc segment, the more column groups functionally determine this column. (There should be no white color in the cord.)

# Inclusion Dependencies
Add the information to which table the column belongs to to each node. This could be done with colors. Each table gets its own color and the nodes are displayed in the color of the table they belong to.

# Unique Column Combinations
Each column should appear in an own color, so that you can recognize faster, which column belongs to how many unique column combinations.
